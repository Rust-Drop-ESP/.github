## 🌐 Overview

**Rust Drop ESP Advanced Visual Tracking Software** is a specialized overlay suite tailored for players who value information as their sharpest weapon. It highlights **airdrops**, **elite crates**, **Bradley/Military loot points**, and **high-value map objects**, giving you the tactical advantage of **early interception**, **route prediction**, and **safe approach planning**.

Unlike general-purpose ESP tools, this system focuses on **precision loot intelligence**—clean visuals, tunable overlays, and near-zero frame cost.

[!NOTE]
Modules are fully configurable: opacity, distance thresholds, filters, and map markers adapt to your playstyle.
